# fastdns-to-terraform

A quick and dirty script to dump out a FastDNS zone to terraform `aws_route53_record` resources.


# Requirements

* Python 3 (tested on 3.7)
* [edgegrid-python](https://github.com/akamai/AkamaiOPEN-edgegrid-python)
* [python-terrascript](https://github.com/mjuenema/python-terrascript)

While the code should work on both Python 2 and 3, python-terrascript only works on Python 3.


# Usage

```
fastdns-to-terraform.py zone > zone.tf.json
```

Uses the `default` section in `~/.edgerc` for auth. This can be customized using `AKAMAI_EDGERC` and `AKAMAI_EDGERC_SECTION`.

To launch it in docker, you'll need to make sure `.edgerc` is present in the container:

```
docker pull bennettp123/fastdns-to-terraform
docker run --rm -it -v "$HOME/.edgerc:/root/.edgerc:ro" \
  bennettp123/fastdns-to-terraform python fastdns-to-terraform.py zone
```

# HCL

`fastdns-to-terraform.py` prints its output in JSON format. You should pipe it through [`json2hcl`](https://github.com/kvz/json2hcl) to convert it to [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl#why).
